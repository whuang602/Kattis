My attempt at Air Conditioned Minions in Python 3

acm.py does not work completely as it's a greedy algorithm aimed around selecting temperature ranges with the most overlaps, as it turns out, with examples like the input inside input.txt, the program will fail.

acm2.py works and functions well because its aim is to sort the ranges by earliest/lowest temperate ends, and selecting those that it overlaps with.
